# Runs in this script rather than with a Hakyll preprocessing step 
#Â (e.g. `preprocess (callCommand "cd projects/notegraph && npm install")`)
# because the preprocessing rule and the compilation rule which copies
# the mathjax files do not seem to run in the same compilation round.
# The copy step only runs _after_ the preprocessing rule has run and
# some other change triggers recompilation.
# Running 'npm install' here ensures that the mathjax files are present
# the first time the site is built.
