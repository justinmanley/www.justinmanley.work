<h3>Fifteen exercises for The Lightning Field</h3>

<ol>
    <b>Points</b>
    <li>
        <p>A point is uniquely determined by the intersection of two non-parallel lines.</p>
        <p>Find the midpoint between two adjacent poles. You’ll need to look back and forth to align yourself roughly halfway between the two poles, and then look out to the diagonals and bring those diagonals into alignment.</p>
        <p>Look back and forth between the adjacent poles. Poles in the Field are 220 feet apart, so you are 110 feet from each pole. This is what a distance of roughly 100 feet looks like. Is it what you expected?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Using the same method, find the midpoint of a square. Once you’ve found it, you’ll be standing in the middle of a patch of desert equidistant from four poles.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If you want an extra challenge, find a point 1/3 of the way between two adjacent poles.</p>
    </li>
    <b>Midlines</b>
    <li>
        <p>
            Standing between two adjacent poles, orient yourself so that one pole is on your left and the other on your right. Ahead, you should see poles converging in the distance. Walk forward along the avenue formed by the two rows of poles on either side, tracing with your body the midline between the two rows. With your gaze forward, resting gently on the horizon or whatever you can see ahead in the desert beyond the Field, observe in your peripheral vision how the pattern of poles on either side of you changes as you move.
        </p>
    </li>
    <b>Circles</b>
    <li>
        <p>Stand a modest distance away from one pole, perhaps fifteen feet. Facing the pole, try to walk sideways in a circle, maintaining a constant distance from the pole.</p>
        <p>How can you tell when you’re on the right track?</p>
        <p>To challenge yourself, try increasing your distance from the pole.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Find the midpoint between two adjacent poles and stand there. Let your gaze rest on the horizon. Spin on the spot, sliding your gaze smoothly along the horizon. As you turn, without slowing or allowing your gaze to get stuck, notice when each of the two nearby poles spins past you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Find the center of one square. Spin on the spot. As you turn, without slowing, notice when each of the four nearby poles spins past you.</p>
        <p>Spin faster. How fast do you have to spin to make all the poles disappear?</p>
    </li>
    <b>Gazes</b>
    <li>
        <p>Wander at random through the field with your gaze resting gently on the horizon. Keep your gaze soft, diffuse, and forward, and try to remain aware of the position and movement of as many poles as possible.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Wander at random through the field. Continually turn your head to check on the positions and alignment of all the poles around you. Let your gaze flick from pole to pole. See if you can identify which poles are about to come into alignment, and observe how it feels when a line of poles do come into alignment.</p>
    </li>
    <b>Paths</b>
    <li>
        <p>Walk through the Field with purpose, towards a destination somewhere within the Field. Choose your destination from the points you know how to reach: the midpoint between two poles, the center of a square, etc. When you reach a destination, look around, pick a new one, and keep walking.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Walk with no destination in mind along the paths you know: down an avenue with poles flanking you on either side; around the perimeter of a circle centered on a nearby pole. When you see an appealing opening to switch onto a different path, take it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Wander the Field: sometimes towards an invisible point, sometimes along an invisible line or circle, sometimes tracing the bare soil between the scrub and grasses, but always with an awareness of how you’re walking.</p>
    </li>
    <b>Lines</b>
    <li>
        <p>Stand just outside the Field, facing a pole from a distance of about fifteen feet, or as far as you need to stand so you can focus on the nearest pole without going cross-eyed. Shift your feet to align a line of poles. Close one eye at a time and make sure that with each eye closed, the line of poles is completely hidden between the closest pole (if you can see any poles with either eye, step back further until they’re all hidden behind the closest pole). Next, turn around to face away from the line of poles. Take ten steps in this direction, then turn back to face the Field. Is the line of poles still perfectly aligned? If not, how many steps (parallel to the edge of the Field) do you have to take in order to realign the poles?</p>
        <p>Return to your original starting point and try again (it’s important to return to the same spot in order to be able to observe your progress across attempts).</p>
        <p>If you find this difficult, try turning so your body is parallel to the edge of the Field, then holding your arms up and out along the line of poles. Turn your hands so your palms face out, and lift them so when you close one eye and turn your head to the side, your index finger is just at the horizon line. Look back towards the Field and make sure your palm is perfectly aligned with the poles, then turn your head away from the field and note which point on the horizon your hand is pointing to. Relax your arms, turn, and without looking back at the Field, walk ten steps towards that point on the horizon.</p>
        <p>Where you end up in relation to the Field will tell you how you need to adjust your outstretched arms for the next attempt so that they form a straight line with the poles.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The same as the previous exercise, but instead of walking straight through the desert away from the Field (potentially stepping or jumping over bushes, anthills, scat, etc), take a meandering path. Without looking back, follow the desert away from the Field, trying to keep your feet on the dirt as much as possible. Step around rather than over plants. Stop when you believe you are about ten paces away in a straight line from your focal pole.</p>
        <p>Repeat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>As before, wander the Field — but now, when you reach the edge of the Field, walk out of it for as long as you like. When you’re ready, turn back, find a new path or pick a new point, and re-enter.</p>
    </li>
