Hi, I'm Justin!

I am a writer and a coder.

My art writing has appeared in [Hyperallergic][] and [Squarecylinder][]. I am drawn to art which is technologically demanding, spatially inventive, obsessive, spare, and ambivalent.

My code powers applications for communicating expressively, building roads and laying power lines, and making videos.

My latest projects explore the interactive possibilities of digitally-native writing through [a short story][lifestory], [an essay on notetaking][notegraph], and [a set of movement exercises][lightningfield].

I live in London.
